<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This cake is a very moist banana cake that's easy to make with banana pudding, cake mix, and bananas. It's a family favorite! The cake can also be baked in a 9x13 pan or an angel food cake pan. It travels well to potlucks or picnics.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
<li>1 (3.5 ounce) package instant banana pudding mix</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>¾ cup mashed bananas</li>
<li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
<li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
<li>½ cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.</li>
<li>Stir cake mix and pudding mix together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in eggs, water, oil and mashed banana. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
<li>To make the glaze: Combine confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Whisk until smooth and a drizzling consistency. When cake is cooled, drizzle icing over cake with a zigzag motion. Sprinkle chopped nuts over wet icing if desired.</li>
</ol>
